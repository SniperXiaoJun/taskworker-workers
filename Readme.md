DREAMaaS middleware workers
---------------------------

This project contains all the workers that process tasks in a workflow. Each
worker is a seperate maven project.
 
Additionally this project contains integration projects (starting with workflow-)
that contain the configuration and the packaging for a specific case workflow.

For more information about the middleware and how to run the case workflows, 
see the core project.
